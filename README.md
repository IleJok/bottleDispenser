# bottleDispenser
A week assignment for LUT object oriented programming course.
First touches with Android Studio and Java.

Bottle Dispenser uses singleton design pattern, because it was part of the assignment.
Bottle class does not, because I think it represent better a real situation, where there is
a one bottle dispenser which has multiple bottle objects inside it.
